# DATA ENGINEERING ZOOMCAMP ‚Äì Final Project
## Overview
This project was developed as a part of the [Data Engineering Zoomcamp](https://github.com/DataTalksClub/data-engineering-zoomcamp) 
course held by [DataTalks.Club](https://datatalks.club/). 
The goal of this project was to build an end-to-end data pipeline, with a focus on: 
* Creating a data pipeline to aid with batch data processing (on a weekly basis);
* Producing an analytical dashboard that will allow to easily discover trends and assimilate insights.

> **Disclaimer** The dataset used for this project was collected between January and April 2023, which makes it a relatively small dataset (X observations). The main idea of this project wasn't to deal with a big dataset at this point, but rater build a pipeline that can fetch, organize and transform present data on a weekly basis. However, it is possible to obtain a bigger dataset if you maintain this pipeline to fetch data for longer time, but for me that wasn't possible due to course deadlines.

## About the Project
The planet Earth is constantly changing üåç. Seismic activity is produced when tectonic plates shift or when other events take place below the surface. While some earthquakes are sizable and do a lot of damage, other earthquakes are so little that they can hardly be felt without sensitive technology. 

Earthquake data is a valuable resource for public safety, and this project aims to look to this information at weekly basis. With the power of this data, we can answer a series of questions:
 * How many earthquakes happened per day? 
 * What is the average earthquake number per continent?
 * How many earthquakes happened near to populated zones? What was its magnitude?
 * Which geographical area had the most earthquakes per week? How many had magnitude higher than 6?



### Dataset used
The data of was collected using [EveryEarthquake API](https://rapidapi.com/dbarkman/api/everyearthquake/), additionally the data obtained between January and April 2023 can be found in the folder `earthquake-data` as parquet files (per week).
To use this API you need to have a **X-RapidAPI-Key**, to obtain your key you first need to create a account, more information can be obtained [here](https://docs.rapidapi.com/docs/keys).

The data fetch directly from *EveryEarthquake API* had unnecessary information that was removed during Prefect flow to fetch data `api_to_gcs.py`, additionally, the dataset needed some initial cleaning that was taken care during the second Prefect flow to load data into Big Query `gcs_to_bq.py`. 
For mode information check the notebook `api_data_exploration.ipynb` or the folder `prefect/flows`.
The complete information about the dataset can be found at [ANSS Comprehensive Earthquake Catalog](https://earthquake.usgs.gov/data/comcat/#event-terms).

The final dataset loaded to Big Query contain the following information:

- id (str): unique ID value that indetifies the event 
- magnitude (float): event registered magnitude
- type (str): type of seismic event - typical values ‚Äúearthquake‚Äù, ‚Äúquarry‚Äù
- felt (int): total number of felt reports submitted
- cdi (float): the maximum reported intensity for the event [0.0, 10.0]
- mmi (float): the maximum estimated instrumental intensity for the event [0.0, 10.0]
- alert (str): alert level from the PAGER earthquake impact scale ‚Äúgreen‚Äù, ‚Äúyellow‚Äù, ‚Äúorange‚Äù, ‚Äúred‚Äù
- status (str): indicates whether the event has been reviewed by a human (status is either automatic or reviewed,automatic events are directly posted by automatic processing systems and have not been verified or altered by a human)
- tsunami (int): set to "1" for large events in oceanic regions and "0" otherwise (the existence or value of this flag does not indicate if a tsunami actually did or will exist)
- sig (int): number describing how significant the event is [0, 1000] (larger numbers indicate a more significant event)
- ids (str):  comma-separated list of event ids that are associated to an event
- gap (float): the largest azimuthal gap between azimuthally adjacent stations (in degrees) (the smaller this number, the more reliable is the calculated horizontal position of the earthquake)
- depth (float): the depth where the earthquake begins to rupture (in km)
- latitude (float): decimal degrees latitude (negative values for southern latitudes) [-90.0, 90.0] - coordinates of the epicenter in units of latitude (the number of degrees north (N) or south (S) of the equator and varies from 0 at the equator to 90 at the poles)
- longitude (float): decimal degrees longitude (negative values for western longitudes) [-180.0, 180.0] - coordinates of the epicenter in units of longitude (longitude is the number of degrees east (E) or west (W) of the prime meridian which runs through Greenwich, England)
- distanceKM (float): distance to populated places that are in close proximity to the seismic event (in km)
- location (str): name of nearest populated plate to seismic event
- continent (str): continent of seismic event
- country (str): continent of seismic event 
- subnational (str): state of seismic event (if applicable) 
- city (str): city of seismic event (if applicable)
- locality (str): locality of seismic event
- date (datetime): date when the event ocurred
- year (int): year when the event ocurred
- week (int): week of the year when the event ocurred
